        <p>50/50 – removes two wrong answers from the multiple-choice selection, leaving the contestant with only one correct and one incorrect option. This means they have a 50/50 chance.</p>
        <p>Ask the Audience – the audience is asked the same question as the contestant and a quick poll is done to show their answers...</p>
        <p>Phone a Friend – Contestants are allowed to make a 30-second call to a friend or family member and ask them if they know the answer to the question.</p>
